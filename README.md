**Prompt flow** is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.

With prompt flow, you will be able to:

- **Create and iteratively develop flow**
    - Create executable [flows](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/concepts/concept-flows.html) that link LLMs, prompts, Python code and other [tools](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/concepts/concept-tools.html) together.
    - Debug and iterate your flows, especially the [interaction with LLMs](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/concepts/concept-connections.html) with ease.
- **Evaluate flow quality and performance**
    - Evaluate your flow's quality and performance with larger datasets.
    - Integrate the testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure quality of your flow.
- **Streamlined development cycle for production**
    - Deploy your flow to the serving platform you choose or integrate into your app's code base easily.
    - (Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by leveraging the cloud version of [Prompt flow in Azure AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/overview-what-is-prompt-flow?view=azureml-api-2).

## Installation

Ensure you have a python environment, `python=3.9` is recommended.

```sh
pip install promptflow promptflow-tools
```

## Quick Start ‚ö°

**Create a chatbot with prompt flow**

Run the command to initiate a prompt flow from a chat template, it creates folder named `my_chatbot` and generates required files within it:

```sh
pf flow init --flow ./my_chatbot --type chat
```

**Setup a connection for your API key**

For OpenAI key, establish a connection by running the command, using the `openai.yaml` file in the `my_chatbot` folder, which stores your OpenAI key (override keys and name with --set to avoid yaml file changes):

```sh
pf connection create --file ./my_chatbot/openai.yaml --set api_key=<your_api_key> --name open_ai_connection
```

For Azure OpenAI key, establish the connection by running the command, using the `azure_openai.yaml` file:

```sh
pf connection create --file ./my_chatbot/azure_openai.yaml --set api_key=<your_api_key> api_base=<your_api_base> --name open_ai_connection
```

**Chat with your flow**

In the `my_chatbot` folder, there's a `flow.dag.yaml` file that outlines the flow, including inputs/outputs, nodes,  connection, and the LLM model, etc

> Note that in the `chat` node, we're using a connection named `open_ai_connection` (specified in `connection` field) and the `gpt-35-turbo` model (specified in `deployment_name` field). The deployment_name filed is to specify the OpenAI model, or the Azure OpenAI deployment resource.

Interact with your chatbot by running: (press `Ctrl + C` to end the session)

```sh
pf flow test --flow ./my_chatbot --interactive
```

## Tutorial üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Prompt Flow is a tool designed to **build high quality LLM apps**, the development process in prompt flow follows these steps: develop a flow, improve the flow quality, deploy the flow to production.

### Develop your own LLM apps

#### VS Code Extension<img src="examples/tutorials/quick-start/media/logo_pf.png" alt="logo" width="25"/>

We also offer a VS Code extension (a flow designer) for an interactive flow development experience with UI.
